                <h4>Initial Client Meeting and Requirement Gathering</h4>
                <p>The recruitment process begins with a formal meeting with the client or employer from the respective country. 
				This discussion focuses on understanding the client's manpower requirements across different sectors, including drivers 
				(light/heavy/bus), civil workers (like electricians, plumbers, masons), hospitality staff (chefs, housekeeping, F&B service), 
				medical professionals (nurses, lab technicians, doctors), manufacturing workers (machine operators, technicians), retail staff 
				(salespersons, cashiers, store managers), and technical/senior roles such as engineers and supervisors. We collects specific job 
				descriptions, quantity, qualifications, salary structures, benefits, and contract durations. This stage also clarifies logistics 
				such as accommodation, transportation, food, medical care, work hours, and end-of-service benefits. Once agreed, the client provides 
				essential documents like a demand letter, power of attorney, employment contracts, and visa authorization letters to legally initiate the recruitment process.</p>

                <h4>Advertising and Talent Sourcing</h4>
                <p>After the requirements are finalized, we begin sourcing suitable candidates through a targeted recruitment campaign. 
				This includes advertisements in local newspapers, online job portals, social media, job fairs, and recruitment partners 
				across the country. Industry-specific sourcing methods are applied — for example, healthcare professionals are sourced 
				through nursing colleges and hospitals, while hospitality and retail workers are be reached via hotel management institutes 
				and retail academies. We also informs our network of sub-agents and field recruiters in different regions to reach candidates 
				in rural and semiurban areas. Simultaneously Walk-in registrations are encouraged at the our 
				offices for candidates to apply directly with theirdocuments and credentials.</p>

                <h4>Candidate Screening and Pre-Qualification </h4>
                <p>The screening process is carefully tailored to match the nature of the job role. All candidates undergo an initial verification 
				of documents including passports, educational certificates, experience letters, and professional licenses (especially for medical and engineering roles).</p>

                <h4>Final Interview with Client or Employer Representative</h4>
                <p>Shortlisted candidates are presented for final interviews, which are either conducted in person at a recruitment venue or virtually through video conferencing. Employers may send a delegation or appoint authorized representatives to assess the candidates.
Engineers and senior staff go through screening for leadership ability, technical expertise, and communication skills. They are also assessed based on age, language skills, physical fitness, and practical experience.
For positions that require hands-on skills — such as civil workers, manufacturing staff, hospitality personnel, and drivers — trade tests are conducted at authorized testing centers. These practical assessments ensure candidates have the required competency in their respective fields, such as masonry, welding, plumbing, machine operation, or vehicle handling. In the hospitality sector, chefs may be asked to prepare specific dishes or showcase plating skills, while housekeepers are tested for speed and accuracy in room setups. Drivers are evaluated on road tests and their knowledge of traffic rules, especially for GCC license holders. Only those who pass these assessments are selected.

                <h4>Medical Examination and Fitness Check</h4>
                <p>After the interview, selected candidates are sent for a medical examination at authorized Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-approved medical centres, 
				such as those under the WAAC) system (formerly GAMCA). The medical test typically includes a physical examination, blood tests, X-rays, and screening for communicable diseases.</p>

                <p>Once medical clearance is received, candidates are instructed to submit their complete documents, including passport copies, 
				passport-size photographs, educational and experience certificates, and the medical fitness report. These documents are forwarded to
				the employer for visa processing. Depending on the Gulf country, the visa may be processed as a paper visa (e-visa)
				or a visa stamped in the candidate's passport through the respective consulate or embassy.</p>

				we facilitate the emigration clearance process through the Protector of Emigrants (POE). Candidates are also given a mandatory PreDeparture Orientation 
				Training (PDOT), which includes guidance on labor laws, work culture, rights and responsibilities, and emergency contact information in the Gulfcountry.</p>

                <p>On the day oftravel, candidates are supported with airport check-in and given a departure file containing all essential documents. 
				After arrival in the Gulf country, we confirm with the employer that the workers have reached safely and joined their respective job sites. 
				We also collect feedback from the employer regarding the candidates' initial performance. If there are any issues such as non-joining or early repatriation, 
				we provide a suitable replacement as per the guarantee clause mentioned in the recruitment agreement.</p>
